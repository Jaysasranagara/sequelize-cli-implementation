This a proof of work of using sequelize-cli to push data into postgreSQL
data is input using sequelize-cli from the terminal, using the code (sequelize init) to first
create the config, model, migrations, and seeders
the db is first create by doing (sequelize db:create), with the model using 
(sequelize model:create --name database --attributes nama:string,umur:string,dataId:string,healthStatus:string)

in here, I can break down the code into 3 part
- model:create    //create the model/table for the database
- --name:         //give a name for the database
- --attributes    //what should the table/model contain, and what type of data is it

the next step is to generate the seed, which I did using (sequelize seed:generate --name  data_dummy)

the seed should show up in the folder of the code as 20210602060107-data_dumdum.js

Finally, we're going to migrate the db using (sequelize db:migrate)

The db should show up in postgreSQL
